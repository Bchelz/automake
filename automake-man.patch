+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+To create all the 
+.BR Makefile.in s 
+for a package, run the 
+.B automake
+program in the top level directory, with no arguments.  
+.B automake
+will automatically find each appropriate 
+.B Makefile.am
+(by scanning
+.BR configure.in )
+and generate the corresponding 
+.BR Makefile.in .
+Note that 
+.B automake
+has a rather simplistic view of what constitutes a package; it assumes
+that a package has only one
+.BR configure.in , 
+at the
+top.  If your package has multiple 
+.BR configure.in s, 
+then you must run
+.B automake
+in each directory holding a 
+.BR configure.in .
+.PP
+You can optionally give 
+.B automake
+an argument; 
+.B .am
+is appended to the argument and the result is used as the name of the
+input file.  This feature is generally only used to automatically
+rebuild an out-of-date
+.BR Makefile.in .  
+Note that 
+.B automake
+must always be run from the topmost directory of a project, even if
+being used to regenerate the
+.B Makefile.in
+in some subdirectory.  This is necessary
+because 
+.B automake
+must scan 
+.BR configure.in ,
+and because 
+.B automake
+uses the knowledge that a 
+.B Makefile.in
+is in a subdirectory to change its behavior in some cases.
+.PP
+.B automake
+accepts the following options:
+.TP
+.BI -a
+.TP
+.BI --add-missing
+Automake requires certain common files to exist in certain
+situations; for instance 
+.B config.guess
+is required if
+.B configure.in
+runs 
+.BR AC_CANONICAL_HOST .  
+Automake is distributed with several of these files; this option will
+cause the missing ones to be automatically added to the package,
+whenever possible.  In general if Automake tells you a file is
+missing, try using this option.
+.TP
+.BI --amdir=\fRDIR
+Look for Automake data files in directory DIR instead of in the
+installation directory.  This is typically used for debugging.
+.TP
+.BI --build-dir=\fRDIR
+Tell Automake where the build directory is.  This option is used
+when including dependencies into a 
+.B Makefile.in
+generated by 
+.B make
+.BR dist ; 
+it should not be used otherwise.
+.TP
+.BI --cygnus
+Causes the generated 
+.BR Makefile.in s 
+to follow Cygnus rules, instead of GNU or Gnits rules.
+.TP
+.BI --foreign
+Set the global strictness to 
+.BR foreign .
+.TP
+.BI --gnits
+Set the global strictness to 
+.BR gnits .
+.TP
+.BI --gnu
+Set the global strictness to 
+.BR gnu .
+This is the default strictness.
+.TP
+.BI --help
+Print a summary of the command line options and exit.
+.TP
+.BI -i
+.TP
+.BI --include-deps
+Include all automatically generated dependency information in the
+generated
+.BR Makefile.in . 
+This is generally done
+when making a distribution.
+.TP
+.BI --no-force
+Ordinarily 
+.B automake
+creates all 
+.BR Makefile.in s
+mentioned in
+.BR configure.in .
+This option causes it to only update those
+.BR Makefile.in s 
+which are out of date with respect to one of their dependents.
+.TP
+.BI -o\ \fRDIR
+.TP
+.BI --output-dir=\fRDIR
+Put the generated 
+.B Makefile.in
+in the directory DIR.  Ordinarily
+each 
+.B Makefile.in
+is created in the directory of the
+corresponding 
+.BR Makefile.am .  
+This option is used when making
+distributions.
+.TP
+.BI --srcdir-name=\fRDIR
+Tell Automake the name of the source directory associated with the
+current build.  This option is used when including dependencies into a
+.B Makefile.in
+generated by 
+.BR make dist ; 
+it should not be used otherwise.
+.TP
+.BI -v
+.TP
+.BI --verbose
+Cause Automake to print information about which files are being read
+or created.
+.TP
+.BI --version
+Print the version number of Automake and exit.

+.TH ACLOCAL 1 "Automake"
+.SH NAME
+aclocal - automatically generate aclocal.m4 from configure.in
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B aclocal
+[
+.BR --acdir= DIR
+] [
+.B --help
+] [
+.B -I
+DIR ] [
+.BR --output= FILE
+] [
+.B --verbose
+] [
+.B --version
+]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Automake includes a number of Autoconf macros which can be used in
+your package; some of them are actually required by Automake in certain
+situations.  These macros must be defined in your 
+.BR aclocal.m4 ;
+otherwise they will not be seen by 
+.BR autoconf .
+.PP
+The 
+.B aclocal
+program will automatically generate 
+.B aclocal.m4
+files based on the contents of 
+.BR configure.in .  
+This provides a convenient way to get Automake-provided macros,
+without having to search around.  Also, the 
+.B aclocal
+mechanism is extensible for use by other packages.
+.PP
+At startup, 
+.B aclocal
+scans all the 
+.B .m4
+files it can find, looking for macro definitions.  Then it scans
+.BR configure.in .  
+Any mention of one of the macros found in the first step causes that
+macro, and any macros it in turn requires, to be put into
+.BR aclocal.m4 .
+.PP
+The contents of 
+.BR acinclude.m4 , 
+if it exists, are also automatically included in 
+.BR aclocal.m4 .  
+This is useful for incorporating local macros into 
+.BR configure .
+.PP
+.B aclocal
+accepts the following options:
+.TP
+.BI --acdir=\fRDIR
+Look for the macro files in DIR instead of the installation
+directory.  This is typically used for debugging.
+.TP
+.BI --help
+Print a summary of the command line options and exit.
+.TP
+.BI -I\fR\ DIR
+Add the directory DIR to the list of directories searched for
+.B .m4
+files.
+.TP
+.BI --output=\fRFILE
+Cause the output to be put into FILE instead of 
+.BR aclocal.m4 .
+.TP
+.BI -v
+.TP
+.BI --verbose
+Print the names of the files it examines.
+.TP
+.BI --version
+Print the version number of Automake and exit.
